## Code Challenge Infos

Use `json-server --watch users.json` to enable the "userDB" and to be able to login to the profile page. Currently there are two users with the following username and passwords:

        {
            "users": [{
                "id": 1,
                "username": "andy",
                "password": "dings"
            }, {
                "id": 2,
                "username": "foozi",
                "password": "bums"
            }]
        }

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Myfunc()

The solution is implmented in `challenge.js` whereas the little shorter version is in `challenge_short.js`. I hate to look at code like this, thus there are two files doing the same thing.

    node challenge.js
